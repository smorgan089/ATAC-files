ATAC Analysis Steps:

1. Transfer files to folder on server. 
2. FastQC
3. Combined files split across multiple lanes if needed ("cat" command, only needed for non-MiSeq runs).
4. cutadapt
5. bowtie2
6. Sort aligned bam files with samtools sort 
7. Remove duplicates with picard
8. remove low quality with samtools -q 10 (optional)
9. call peaks with macs2
10. Use Diffbind of ChIPSeeker to look at differential peaks.
11. Annotate & find motifs etc. with homer (or I think ChIPseeker can also do this?)
